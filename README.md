The purpose of this project was to learn different aspects of testing thorough the use of mocha chai. First part was to clone the repo from the San Diego Code School repository. Then it moved on to building a basic calculator and write simple tests following the "Red-Green-Refactor" method.

Next, a mortgage calculator constructor function was built. Four unit tests accompanied this module.

The next and final part of this project was to build a React Component with End-to-End tests using NightmareJS to make sure our React component will work as expected. Once the tests were written, a functional End-to-end test that involves interacting with the webpage was created.
